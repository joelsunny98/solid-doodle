 # Description: 
 This is an end-to-end message sharing platform, where the sender and reciever share a key before hand. The key is used to encrypt and further on decrypt the message. Anyone who does not have the Key will not be able to decrypt the message. 
 We use the ASCII letter convertion and add and subtract the key that the user set up to do the Encryption and Decription.
